Arduino final project documentation
	
	Our Arduino driven Lego-bot (A.K.A. Bob) takes values from the ultrasonic sensor, and then follows whatâ€™s closest to it.
	We put the ultra-sonic sensor on a micro servo so that we could take values at 5 different angles. Once we found each of the
	distances at each of the angles, we found the smallest, then adjusted the angle of travel on bob. 
	
	Although it seemed like an easier project, we had some difficulties. First, we had to use the ultrasonic sensor and
	find an average of values to be most precise. Second, we needed to make the micro servo sweep from side to side 
	to take different values. And finally, we had to move the wheels according to the angle of the shortest recording. 
	We had trouble with the last part.
	
	It was fun and challenging.
